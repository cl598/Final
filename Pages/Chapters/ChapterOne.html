    <h3>Hau</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        A shining light laid upon a tall, floating figure by a large crystal shard displaying in the middle of the room. The light glistening against the crystal through the window that carries the colorful rays throughout the whole space. Standing against one of the bright rays is a woman with long, white hair that hangs below her bare feet. She gazes at its beauty, admiring the sparkling light that is shimmering with energy. “... Beautiful” she whispers, placing her pale hand onto the crystal.
        Behind the white haired woman, a young woman in her 20s appeared out of thin air, kneeling with her head down. The young woman extended her arms out to hold out a clipped, large pile of paper, “The reports have arrived, young miss.”
        “... It’s fine to call me Hau, Kryssa, I don’t mind.” Hau turned around, her soft, white eyes looking at Kryssa with a small smile. “Nor must you kneel” She reached out to pull up Kryssa’s arms to motion her to stand up. Kryssa lifted her head, following her request to stand. “That may be difficult to achieve, young miss.” She handed over the reports to Hau, “Please call me if you need any assistance. I must head back to unravel a problem in the finance department.” Kryssa gave a bow before disappearing again into thin air.
        “Haha… formal as ever.” Hau floated behind her desk and sat midair, observing the first page of the report to find out its content. “I see, these are the monthly reports.” She sighed, dreading to read this large pile of papers, “Time to begin.”
